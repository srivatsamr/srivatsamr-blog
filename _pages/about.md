***Cogito***. I *think*.

When I say *think*, I mean the process where I go through the steps of attempting to understand something, form a logical sequence of statements and arguments and come to some conclusions. In my life so far, I consciously *think* when I am either learning something or explaining something that I *feel* I understand well. I am emphasising the usage of *feel* in the previous sentence because I know I am very likely to be wrong at many places. The idea is that, writing my thoughts out like this will force me to think twice! And I hope to iron out any inconsistencies in my understanding of the things that I care about in my life by thinking rigorously about them at least twice.

This blog doesn't conform to the usual suggestions I found online when researching about blogging - pick a niche. I don't *think* about a particular niche. So I hope that if you ended up here to read about my thoughts on a topic that we share an interest in, you leave either convinced that I am right or leave gaining better appreciation of your own understanding which can trivially prove that I am wrong. If its the latter, please share them with me! I love learning.
